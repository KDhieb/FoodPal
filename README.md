## A Daily Meal and Calorie Tracker

#### What this application does

This application allows users to track the food they consume 
on a daily basis to monitor their dietary and nutritional habits. 
You can also *store your frequently consumed meals* to refer to and 
add again in the future. The application also allows you to *track
the calories and ingredients of each meal*, and can *display the 
total daily calories* consumed. You may also refer back
to past days and *view previous entries*.

#### Who should use this application


This application is directed towards health conscious individuals
and people who are trying to improve their dietary habits by 
understanding what they eat on a daily basis. This application can
serve as a way to hold yourself accountable for your diet and to
gain control on how many calories you consume every day. People who
also want to track recipe ingredients can use this application
as a way to store that information.

#### Why this project is of interest to me

Being a health conscious person myself, I appreciate software solutions
that aim to facilitate healthier lifestyle choices. Given that I have used 
similar applications in the past, I would see myself personally using this
platform. Also, by being familiar with health applications, 
I believe that I am in a good position to add my own value and differentiation
to this kind of solution.

- Track daily meals eaten and their ingredients
- Track calories per meal
- View daily calories consumed
- View and display current and previous days
